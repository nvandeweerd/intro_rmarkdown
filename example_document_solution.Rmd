# Abstract

R Markdown [@Allaire2020a; @Xie2018; @Xie2020a] is a suite of tools that allow you to seamlessly integrate 
text and R code together to create fully reproducible documents. From one R Markdown file, 
you can easily create various output files including Word documents, Powerpoints, conference posters 
and [much more](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)! This introductory workshop will go over the basics of R Markdown and demonstrate how it can be used to support reproducible research. A basic knowledge of R is assumed but no prior knowledge of R Markdown is required.

> R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.

## Topics covered:

- Introduction to R Markdown
- Integrating R code in your R Markdown document
- Inserting graphics and tables
- Adding a bibliography



# Integrating R code

Code chunks:

```{r}
1+1
```

Inline code:

The sum of 1 + 1 is `r 1+1`.

# Inserting graphics

```{r, out.width="25%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Project Members"}
knitr::include_graphics("cecl.png")
```


# Inserting tables


```{r, echo=FALSE}
lsnp.info <- read.csv("data/lsnp.info.csv")
knitr::kable(lsnp.info, caption = "Text lengths by task" )
```

# Inserting plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
barplot(lsnp.info$mean ~ lsnp.info$TASK)
```
