# Introduction to R Markdown

R Markdown is a suite of tools that allow you to seamlessly integrate 
text and R code together to create fully reproducible documents. From one R Markdown file, 
you can easily create various output files including Word documents, Powerpoints, conference posters 
and [much more](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)! This introductory workshop will go over the basics of R Markdown and demonstrate how it can be used to support reproducible research. A basic knowledge of R is assumed but no prior knowledge of R Markdown is required.

Topics covered:

- Introduction to R Markdown  
- Integrating R code in your R Markdown document  
- Inserting graphics and tables  
- Adding a bibliography
