Abstract

R Markdown is a suite of tools that allow you to seamlessly integrate 
text and R code together to create fully reproducible documents. From one R Markdown file, 
you can easily create various output files including Word documents, Powerpoints, conference posters 
and much more! This introductory workshop will go over the basics of R Markdown and demonstrate how it can be used to support reproducible research. A basic knowledge of R is assumed but no prior knowledge of R Markdown is required.

R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.

Topics covered:

Introduction to R Markdown  
Integrating R code in your R Markdown document  
Inserting graphics and tables  
Adding a bibliography
